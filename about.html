    <h1>About Me
    
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am a Senior at Phillip O Berry Academy of Technology that is getting ready to graduate in a week or so. I'm also attending UNCC in the
      fall to study Computer Science. Throughout my high school career, I have taken multiple computer science courses to help elevate my 
      understanding of that field as something I want to pursue in the future. I've taken courses such as Python, Java, and even used different 
      programming software such as Snap. I plan to use this knowledge and experience to drive me further down the computer science field in the 
      hopes of one making a meaningful contribution to the industry.

    <p>Technology has always been apart of my life, ever since I was a little boy. From the tablets and celular devices to the bluetooth refrigerators
      and smart watches, I have always been surrounded by electronic devices that really piqued my interest in the field. It seems as if anything that 
      we can interact with on a daily basis has some form of code built in as well as instructions telling the user how to interact with the program. 
      When I graduate from UNCC, I plan on working with the software development business to create more day-to-day electronic devices to further carry
      out human tasks as efficiently and swiftly as possible.
