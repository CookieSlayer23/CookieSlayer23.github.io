      Hello, my name is Ahmed and I am glad to say that I have completed the AP Computer Science A Course.
    </p>
      
    <p>This course revolves around the basics of the computer programming language we know as JAVA.
      
    <p>Java is one of the early programming languages that people today still use today. Java was first released in 1995 to develop advanced software and a small, reliable operating platform. 
      It was created by James Gosling and his research team in an effort to create a new language that would allow electronic devices to communicate with each other. Java has brought multimedia 
      to the Internet and helped to power consumer devices such as telephones, computers, and even the NASA rovers. Long story short, Java has made it much easier to live on Earth due to it's
      advancements and quick tasks.
